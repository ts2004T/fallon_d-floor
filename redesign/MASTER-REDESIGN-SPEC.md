# FINAL APPROVED DESIGN DECISIONS

This section supersedes any conflicting recommendations elsewhere in this document.

## Project Identity

StatPadder is a football analytics platform.

The final product should feel like:

- StatsBomb
- FBref
- Wyscout
- Hudl
- Opta

and NOT like:

- a portfolio website
- a football fan page
- a social media application
- an Instagram-inspired dashboard

The goal is:

**Professional football analytics platform with personality.**

---

## Typography System (Final)

Previous typography recommendations are overridden.

Use:

### Headings

Sora

Purpose:

- Page titles
- Section headers
- Hero headings
- Card headings

### Body Text

Inter

Purpose:

- Navigation
- Paragraphs
- Labels
- Forms
- Buttons
- Tables
- General UI

### Metrics & Analytics

Space Grotesk

Purpose:

- Scores
- BGPI ratings
- Rankings
- Statistics
- KPI cards
- Charts
- Tables
- Numerical data

Do not use:

- Architects Daughter
- Shantell Sans
- Gaegu

The application should feel analytical, modern, and recruiter-ready.

---

## Brand Personality

Preserve the StatPadder personality.

Keep:

- GOAT Audit
- football humor
- playful insights
- memorable labels
- lighthearted copywriting

Examples:

- "The maths behind the jokes."
- "Can your favorite player do it on a rainy Tuesday?"
- "Certified clutch."

However:

Humor should support the analytics experience, not dominate it.

Analytics must remain the primary focus.

---

## Navigation Structure

Final navigation:

- Dashboard
- Live Match
- GOAT Audit
- Analytics

Do not add:

- About
- Portfolio
- Personal branding pages

Leaderboard functionality should be integrated into Dashboard and GOAT Audit.

---

## Design Philosophy

The redesign folder is the source of truth.

Priority order:

1. MASTER-REDESIGN-SPEC.md
2. redesign/styles.css
3. redesign/Home.html
4. redesign/Live Match.html
5. redesign/GOAT Audit.html
6. redesign/Analytics.html
7. redesign/All_Pages.html

If conflicts occur, follow the highest-priority source.

---

## Frontend Migration Rules

The redesign folder contains design references.

The frontend folder contains production code.

The objective is NOT to copy HTML files directly.

The objective is to:

- Extract the design system
- Extract reusable patterns
- Convert them into reusable React/Next.js components
- Preserve existing functionality
- Preserve API integrations
- Preserve backend integrations

Avoid duplicating markup.

Favor reusable components.

---

## Implementation Workflow

Implementation must occur in phases.

After each phase:

1. Show modified files.
2. Explain changes.
3. Verify functionality.
4. Wait for approval before continuing.

Do not implement multiple phases simultaneously.

---

## Success Criteria

The finished product should immediately communicate:

"This is a serious football analytics platform built by someone who understands sports data products."

The finished product should be suitable for:

- internship applications
- sports analytics portfolios
- data analyst portfolios
- football technology showcases
- recruiter review

All design decisions should support this outcome.

Note: it is a **static HTML prototype suite**, not a framework app. `fallon/styles.css` (217 lines) is the de-facto design system. |

Key finding up front: the reference materials are all in the **pink/lavender "Fallon d'Floor" brand**, while the palette mandates a **warm retro sunset scheme**. The redesign = keep the Fallon layout, structure, and personality; re-token the entire color system to the NYNÄ palette; resolve the StatPadder-vs-Fallon brand and IA inconsistencies.

---

## 1. UI Audit

**Token system is good but constantly bypassed.** `styles.css` defines a clean CSS-variable system (`--pink`, `--lav`, `--radius`, shadows, 4 font vars, light+dark themes), but the HTML pages hardcode dozens of raw hex gradients inline (`#FF6FB5`, `#D9A5FF`, `#8FB7FF`, `#7EE7C0`, `#FFB07E`…) for avatars, crests, banners, chart fills, and SVG strokes. A palette swap via tokens alone will miss ~40% of color usage. All inline hexes must be migrated to tokens.

**Inline styles dominate the markup.** Nearly every card, row, and number carries `style="..."` attributes (sizes, gaps, fonts, colors), including hardcoded `rgb(...)` text colors that won't adapt to dark mode (e.g. footer text `rgb(62,58,68)`). These need to become utility classes/components.

**Two competing visual languages.** The wireframes use Gaegu + Space Mono, paper-dot background, wobbly 2px sketch borders; the prototype uses Architects Daughter + Shantell Sans + Space Grotesk with soft pink glow shadows. The shipped product should commit to one (the prototype language, re-colored).

**Font inconsistency inside the prototype itself.** `--font-display` is set to Architects Daughter, yet pages re-declare `font-family: "Architects Daughter"` and `"Shantell Sans"` inline per-element, sometimes overriding the variables they should rely on. The merged build even overrides `body` to Architects Daughter — a handwriting font — for _all_ body text.

**Broken render.** `shots/home.png` shows an empty page below the nav — the hash-router/reveal interplay can leave a page blank (router toggles `.current` while `.reveal` animation-delay re-staggers). Needs a fix in the rebuild.

**Other issues:** emoji used as functional icons (⚽🟨🅰️ in the event feed, 🌙 theme toggle) render inconsistently across OSes; micro-typography drops to 10–12.5px in charts/chips (below comfortable minimums); radii are mostly tokenized but `11px/12px/16px` one-offs appear inline; the `.glows` fixed backdrop hardcodes pink/lavender rgba values; `--maxw:1180px` is fine but section spacing is ad-hoc inline padding.

**Accessibility.** Pink `#FF6FB5` on white fails WCAG AA for text (≈2.6:1) yet is used for the signature BGPI numbers; same risk transfers to Coral Glow `#FA855A` (≈2.5:1 on white) and Sky Blue `#62C4DA` (≈2.1:1) — the new palette **requires** deep variants for any text usage (Tomato Jam passes at ≈5.4:1). Live badge relies on color alone; charts have no text alternatives; focus states are unstyled.

---

## 2. UX Audit

**Information architecture is inconsistent across artifacts.** Wireframes: Dashboard · Live Match · GOAT Audit · Leaderboard · About. Prototype: Home · Live Match · GOAT Audit · Analytics (no Leaderboard, no About; screenshots show an About link that goes nowhere). Decision needed — recommended IA: **Dashboard · Live Match · GOAT Audit · Analytics**, with the leaderboard folded into Dashboard (wireframe Direction A proved it works as the hero) and About demoted to footer.

**No mobile navigation.** `.navlinks` is simply `display:none` under 880px with no hamburger/sheet replacement — all pages become unreachable on mobile.

**Strong points to preserve:** the bento dashboard with one tap-through per module ("Tap to see what happened →", "View why →", "Learn more →") creates a coherent hub-and-spoke flow; the Live Match "What just happened" explainer card is the product's best idea (translates a stat change into a sentence); GOAT Audit verdict chips (Certified clutch / Jury still out / Stat-merchant alert) give instant scannability; theme toggle persists correctly.

**Gaps:** no loading/empty/error states anywhere (everything assumes live data exists); analytics charts are static SVG with no tooltips, no time-range or competition filters, no player switcher (the xG chart is hardcoded to Bellingham); GOAT Audit shows only 4 players with no search/sort/compare; hash router scrolls to top on every navigation but keeps no scroll memory; the live event feed has no "new event" affordance despite an "Auto-updating" chip; footer "Built with" chips (Python · SQL · Power BI) appear on every page but link nowhere.

---

## 3. Component Inventory (current, from `fallon/styles.css` + pages)

**Layout & chrome:** `.wrap` (1180px container) · `.nav`/`.nav-in`/`.brand`/`.navlinks`/`.icon-btn` (sticky blurred nav) · `.footer`/`.footer-in` · `.glows` (fixed radial backdrop) · `.section`/`.section-head` · `.page` router views.

**Surfaces:** `.card` (+`.pad`, `.hoverable`) · `.pcard` (GOAT player card: `.banner`, `.rankchip`, `.pav`, `.pbody`, `.topline`, `.status`, `.verdict`) · `.ministat` tiles · `.stile` stat tiles · gradient explainer cards (inline).

**Actions:** `.btn` (default, `.primary` pink-gradient, `.lav`, `.sm`) · `.linkmore` arrow links · theme toggle button.

**Indicators:** `.chip` (default/`pink`/`lav`/`mint`/`coral`) · `.live` pulsing badge · `.eyebrow` section labels · `.kicker` hero pill · `.up`/`.down` delta arrows · `.bgpi` signature number.

**Identity:** `.av` gradient monogram avatars (a1–a6) · `.badge-crest` team crests · ball logo SVG.

**Data display:** `.rrow` ranking rows · `.scoreline`/`.scorecard` match scores · event feed (`.ev`, `.min`, `.ic` goal/card/assist variants) · `.factbig` trending fact.

**Charts (hand-rolled):** `.bars`/`.bartrack`/`.bar` histogram · `.hbar-row/track/fill` horizontal bars · inline SVG scatter, line, and area/momentum charts (`.axis`, `.grid-l`, `.alab`) · `.poss` possession bar · `.heat` 12×7 heatmap (JS-generated) · `.legend`/`.dotk` · `.statgrid`.

**Utility:** `.num`/`.mono`/`.display`/`.muted`/`.faint` text helpers · `.reveal` stagger animation · `tweaks-panel.jsx` (React tweaks shell — dev tool, keep out of production bundle).

Missing components the redesign needs: mobile nav drawer, tooltip, tabs/filter pills, search input, table (leaderboard), skeleton/empty state, toast ("BGPI updated" appears in wireframes but has no component).

## 4. Typography Recommendations

Keep the three-tier system, fix the roles, and stop overriding it inline:

| Role            | Token                        | Face                    | Usage rules                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display         | `--font-display`             | **Architects Daughter** | H1/H2 + card "status" one-liners only, ≥21px, never for body or UI labels. It's the brand voice — ration it.                    |
| Body & UI       | `--font-body`                | **Shantell Sans**       | 15–16px body, 500–600 weights for labels/buttons. Remove the merged build's `body{font-family:"Architects Daughter"}` override. |
| Numerals & code | `--font-num` / `--font-logo` | **Space Grotesk**       | All BGPI numbers, scores, deltas, axis labels, chips with values; keep `tabular-nums`. Also the wordmark.                       |

Scale (replace ad-hoc inline sizes): 12 / 13.5 / 15 / 16 / 18 / 21 / 25 / 30 / clamp hero (40→78). Floors: never below 12px; chart axis labels move from 10px → 12px. Eyebrows stay Space Grotesk-style uppercase but at 12.5px+ with `.06em` tracking. Line heights: display 1.02–1.1, body 1.45–1.5. If a calmer look is ever wanted, the drop-in swap is Space Grotesk for display and a humanist sans for body — but the reference materials clearly want the handwritten personality, so the recommendation is keep-and-discipline, not replace.

## 5. Color Mapping Recommendations

New token set built from the NYNÄ palette (old token → new value):

| Token                               | Old                   | New                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                      |

Gradient recipes (replace all inline hexes): avatars/crests rotate through coral→peach, sky→honeydew, tomato→coral, peach→sky; primary button `linear-gradient(135deg,#FA855A,#FFB088)`; hbar fill `90deg, #62C4DA → #FA855A`; histogram bars coral→peach; momentum area coral fade; heatmap opacity ramp on Coral Glow with Tomato hotspots; possession bar coral vs sky.

Hard rule: Coral Glow, Sky Blue, and Soft Peach are **fill/large-number colors only** — any text under ~24px uses the deep variants (Tomato Jam, sky-deep, peach-deep).

## 6. Dashboard (Home) Redesign Recommendations

Keep the prototype's hero + bento structure, upgraded with the wireframes' best ideas:

1. **Hero** — kicker pill, the "rainy Tuesday" H1 with `.pop` span in Coral Glow (large enough to pass contrast), sub, two CTAs (primary = coral gradient, secondary = outlined). Honeydew bg with coral/sky glow backdrop.
2. **Bento grid** (2×2 + tall right column, as today) re-mapped: Live-now card (crests in coral/sky gradients, score in Space Grotesk, live badge in tomato); **GOAT scoreboard card promoted** per wireframe Direction A — add ▲/▼ delta column next to BGPI (the prototype dropped it; the wireframe rightly keeps "live movement" visible); Player of the Day card on Soft Peach wash with "+18 today" chip; Trending Fact card with the stat highlighted in Tomato Jam.
3. **Add the toast** from the wireframes ("✨ BGPI updated — Bellingham +18, 90+2' winner") as a dismissible top-right notification — it sells the "live index" concept on arrival.
4. **Mobile:** bento collapses to single column (already specced) + new hamburger→sheet nav; CTAs full-width.
5. **States:** skeleton shimmer for the live card when no match is on, swapping to "Next match in…"; this is the only page that must degrade gracefully when nothing is live.
6. Rename nav "Home" → **Dashboard** (matches wireframes and product mental model), fold Leaderboard into the GOAT scoreboard card's "View full leaderboard →".

## 7. Analytics Page Redesign Recommendations

Keep the page's structure (head → BGPI explainer → 2-col chart grid → full-width momentum → match analytics) and fix substance:

1. **Pagehead:** keep "The maths behind the jokes." Replace the tech-stack chips (Python/SQL/Power BI — portfolio noise for end-users) with **filter controls**: season/competition select + player picker, so every chart answers to the same filters. Move stack chips to the footer/About.
2. **KPI strip** (new, above the grid): 4 `.stile` tiles — players audited, mean BGPI, biggest riser, biggest stat-merchant gap — Space Grotesk numerals in Tomato Jam.
3. **Chart recolor:** series A coral, series B sky blue, danger annotations tomato ("stat merchants" zone gets a tomato-soft wash rather than red text floating in space), peach for reference/secondary bars, grid lines from `--line`. One legend component reused everywhere.
4. **Chart upgrades:** raise axis type to 12px; add hover tooltips (title + value) via a tiny shared JS helper on the existing SVGs — no chart library needed at this scale; give the scatter quadrant labels ("clutch", "stat merchants") as styled pills; xG chart gets the player picker (currently hardcoded Bellingham); momentum chart annotates goals with peach markers + minute labels.
5. **Match analytics block:** possession bar coral-vs-sky; heatmap becomes Coral Glow opacity ramp (deterministic data, not `Math.random()` — current code generates different "facts" each load, which undercuts a "fact-checked" brand); keep the stat tile grid.
6. **Accessibility:** every SVG gets `role="img"` + `aria-label` summarizing the takeaway; add a visually-hidden data table for the Top-10 bar chart.

## Proposed implementation order (after your sign-off)

1. Re-token `styles.css` (new palette, both themes, shadows, glows) — single source of truth.
2. Sweep all inline hexes/rgb() in the four pages onto tokens/utility classes; fix dark-mode leaks.
3. Typography discipline pass (remove inline font overrides, apply scale, fix merged-build body font).
4. Nav: rename Dashboard, add mobile sheet; fix the blank-page router bug.
5. Dashboard upgrades (deltas on GOAT card, toast, states).
6. Analytics upgrades (filters, KPI strip, tooltips, deterministic heatmap, recolor).
7. Verify: contrast checks on every text/accent pair, light+dark screenshots of all four pages.

**Open questions before I write code:** (a) Dashboard vs Home naming — go with Dashboard? (b) Keep handwritten display font or switch to a cleaner face? (c) Should the standalone single-file build remain the deliverable, or the split `fallon/` pages?

## Product Roadmap Clarification

The StatPadder experience is organized into distinct product layers.

### Dashboard

Purpose:

Provide a high-level overview of the football analytics ecosystem.

Focus:

- Discovery
- Highlights
- Navigation
- Trending insights

---

### GOAT Audit

Purpose:

Evaluate players through BGPI and ranking systems.

Focus:

- Rankings
- Comparisons
- Verdicts
- Player evaluation

---

### Analytics

Purpose:

Explain performance through statistical evidence.

Focus:

- Visualizations
- Insights
- Trends
- Methodology

---

### Match Intelligence Center

Purpose:

Analyze individual matches using StatPadder metrics.

Focus:

- Match narratives
- Key performers
- Match importance
- Player impact
- Match-level insights

This section should prioritize football intelligence over score tracking.

StatPadder is not intended to replicate Sofascore, Fotmob, or Flashscore.

The objective is to explain what happened and why it mattered.

---

### Real-Time Match Intelligence (Future Phase)

Purpose:

Extend Match Intelligence into a live experience.

Potential future capabilities:

- Live event ingestion
- Real-time BGPI updates
- Live player rankings
- Dynamic match narratives
- Streaming analytics

This phase requires additional infrastructure and data providers.

Examples:

- API-Football
- Sportmonks
- Football-Data APIs

Real-Time Match Intelligence is considered an advanced future capability and is not required for the core StatPadder product.

---

### Product Philosophy

StatPadder should prioritize:

Insight → Analysis → Understanding

rather than:

Scores → Fixtures → Notifications

The product should be remembered for its football intelligence, not for replicating existing score-tracking applications.
